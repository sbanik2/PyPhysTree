# Continuum-Scale Design Optimization

This demonstration applies `PyPhysTree`'s **MCTS optimization framework** to a constrained engineering design problem. This example highlights the algorithm's ability to handle strict physical constraints in a continuous search space.

## 📋 Overview

* **Objective**: Minimize the total cost.
* **Design Variables**: (You may want to add a list of variables here if they were provided in the original context.)
* **Constraints**: Must satisfy four structural and geometric conditions.
* **Optimizer**: Physics-Informed **MCTS** with constraint-aware penalty handling and directional sampling.

### Run the Optimization

Execute the script to start the design search:

```bash
python Design_optimize.py
````
